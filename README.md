##  Predicting Breast Cancer in Patients

### Overview
Breast cancer is a significant cause of mortality among women globally. This project aims to classify whether a patient has breast cancer using ensemble methods. The dataset includes numerous features derived from cell nuclei measurements.

### Data Details
The dataset includes predictor variables that describe characteristics of cell nuclei, with a target variable `Diagnosis` that indicates 'Benign' (no cancer) or 'Malignant' (cancer).

### Project Workflow:
1. **Data Preprocessing & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
2. **Model Building with Ensemble Techniques**
3. **Model Evaluation**
4. **Hyperparameter Optimization**

### Main Script:
- `breastcancer_prediction.ipynb`: Contains code for preprocessing, EDA, model training, evaluation, and tuning.

### Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC AUC Score

### Execution:
```bash
python breast_cancer_prediction.ipynbpy
